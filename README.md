[Project Reference | Unmaintained | Made with Unreal Engine 4.13]

# UE4-CPP-Tutorial
The [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4) C++ tutorial ["3rd Person Powerup Game"](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gYup-gvJtMsgJqnEB_dGiM4/mSRov77hNR4/index.html).

This repository hosts a completed version of the project.

The code has been condensed, with comments, to follow a cleaner coding style than what is shown in the tutorial. It is intended as a reference for those who are starting out with C++ in UE4.
